  	div-tag: People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I do not believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they cannot find them, make them. Begin to be now what you will be hereafter. If you are not fired with enthusiasm, you will be fired with enthusiasm. I do not seek. I find. Your self-beliefs either support or undermine you.

  	p-tag: In the long run, men hit only what they aim at. Therefore, they had better aim at something high. The difference between doers and dreamers is that the latter wait for the mood before taking action while the former create the mood by acting. You cannot pick cherries with your back to the tree. When one door closes another opens. Expect that new door to reveal even greater wonders and glories and surprises. Feel yourself grow with every experience. And look for the reason for it Begin to be now what you will be hereafter.

Break a habit. Do something that makes you feel insecure. Carry out an action with complete attention and intensity as if it were your last If you are not fired with enthusiasm, you will be fired with enthusiasm.
